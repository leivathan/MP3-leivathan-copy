# MP3-leivathan-copy
This is my (Andrew Kim's) copy of Machine Projecct 3, ConnectN, for the 2018 spring semester of CS 125, Introduction to Computer Science, at the University of Illinois.
The purpose of this project was to introduce the basic concepts of object-oriented programming. This was achieved through coding a simple game of Connect 4 (or Connect N, since it actually extrapolated out into the N case).
Code which I (Andrew Kim) worked on is marked by commits that start with either "I set up connectN, doing the constructors, getters and setters for width, height, and N, and javadoc so checkstyle is ok." Or "I did a whole lot of shit" (removed from later commits)
